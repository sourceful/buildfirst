# JavaScript Application Design [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/buildfirst/buildfirst.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/buildfirst/buildfirst)
#### _A Build First Approach_

![buildfirst.png][1]

Accompanying code samples and snippets for the _JavaScript Application Design: A Build First Approach_ book.

These are the accompanying code samples and snippets for a book I wrote about **JavaScript build processes and application architecture**. The samples are organized by chapter, and they appear in the same order as they do in the book, for convenience. Many [other resources for this book are listed in its website][2], such as links to _blog posts, articles, essays, books_, and any other particularly relevant topics discussed throughout the book.

#### Fell out of the skies and would like to learn more about the book?

You could [visit its landing page][3] to learn all about it!

Book buying frenzy? [Say no more, stranger!][4]

# Installation

You'll need **Node.js**. You can get the latest version [from their website][5], although I'd suggest using [`nvm`][6], which makes it super easy to install multiple versions, and switch between them.

Once you have Node, use the command below to clone this repository and install all of the dependencies:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildfirst/buildfirst/master/install.sh | sh
```

<sub>If you're on **Windows** use `install-dos.sh`, instead.</sub>

> That's it! You are now free to _roam the sample directories_ and follow the instructions in each of them!

Manual installation instructions [can be found here][7], _but you shouldn't need any of that_.

# Execution

To run an example, read its [README.md][8] and follow the instructions I've placed there. I tried to make them as straightforward as possible, but sometimes they might not match the examples in the book to the letter.

There are some examples here that you _won't find on the book_, those will generally be a bit longer: exactly the reason why I _didn't include them_ in the book. Although the code itself might not be present in the book, most of the explaining will definitely be there, rather than here.

# Release History

This is the list of releases to date. You can feel free to simply clone `master`, to get the most up-to-date version.

- [Final Review][19]
- [Two Thirds Review][18]
- [One Third Review][9]

You can find [the repository up on GitHub][10], which contains the latest updates to the samples, and interactively renders the Markdown code in this text, displaying images, making code prettier, styling the text, and letting you follow links.

### Troubleshooting

If you run into any problems, please create an issue [here][11]. Maybe it's something that needs fixing. If you feel like contributing, that's awesome! Just fork this repo and create a [pull request][12] with your fixes or improvements.

### Feedback

Feedback **about the book itself** should be posted on the [Manning Online Author Forum][13]. You can drop me a line at [buildfirst@bevacqua.io][14] if you want to leave me _a more personal note_, just say hi, or grunt at me about my failure to amuse you. I'd love to hear from you!

You can also find me blogging at [Pony Foo][15]. My Twitter account is [@nzgb][16], and I enjoy people stalking me over the Internet!

Let the [**#buildfirst**][17] revolution commence!
